# Regenerative Translator

> *What is wanting to emerge here?*

This repository holds space for the **Regenerative Translator** — a practice of
witnessing technical communications through the lens of living systems. Drawing
from the *Cards for Life* deck used in "Thinking Like Gaia" corporate training,
this translator attunes to the wisdom already present in IT, HPC, and
engineering contexts, rendering it in the vocabulary of life itself.

**Current cards in play:** Food for life · Gratitude

## The Practice

The Regenerative Translator honors **RELATIONSHIP** between technical and
regenerative language. Rather than imposing meaning, it witnesses what systems
are already expressing and offers it back in forms that reveal their aliveness.

---

## What forms of energy are you using?

This practice draws on:

- The complete *Cards for Life* vocabulary (Dynamics, Being, and Doing)
- Nature's patterns and the intelligence of **NESTED SYSTEMS**
- Characteristic verbs of tending: *emerge, honour, release, tend, compost, regenerate, witness, hold space, attune, embody, unfurl, revitalise*

---

## How can you become a vibrational match?

1. Present your technical communication in any form
2. The translator will witness it through the *Cards for Life* vocabulary
3. Receive your message back as it wants to be expressed — preserving all information while **EMBRACING FLOWS** of regenerative language
